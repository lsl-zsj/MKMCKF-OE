# MKMCKF-OE
Orientation estimation for IMUs using multi-kernel maximum Correntropy Kalman filter

The code can be executed simply by running AHRS_compare_rot2.m or AHRS_compare_rot2_mag.m, where we compare the performance orientation estimation using GD, ESKF, and our filter MKMCKF-OE. For the detailed description, one can refer to our article "Multi-kernel Maximum Correntropy Kalman Filter for Orientation Estimation".
